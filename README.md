just Built a Simple Yet Secure Password Generator in Python!

I'm exploring Python programming and recently created a random password generator to improve both my coding skills and awareness of digital security. 
This task is a part of the @codesoft hashtag#pythondevelopment

✅ Task Overview:
The goal was to create a script that:
Accepts user input for desired password length
Generates a random, secure password
Validates input to ensure usability

⚙️ How It Works:
The script uses Python’s built-in random and string modules.
It combines uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
A try-except block is used to handle input errors.
The password is generated using a for loop with random .choice().
